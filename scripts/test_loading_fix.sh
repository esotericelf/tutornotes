echo "🔧 What was fixed:"
echo "   1. Added timeout to profile creation (10 seconds)"
echo "   2. Removed profile loading blocking from Dashboard"
echo "   3. Added better error handling for profile creation"
echo "   4. Fixed references to non-existent 'created_at' column"
echo ""

echo "🧪 To test the fix:"
echo "   1. Start your development server: npm start"
echo "   2. Navigate to /login"
echo "   3. Click 'Continue with Google'"
echo "   4. Complete Google authentication"
echo "   5. Check that you're redirected to /dashboard within 10 seconds"
echo "   6. Verify that the loading spinner doesn't hang indefinitely"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected behavior:"
echo "   - Authentication should complete within a few seconds"
echo "   - Dashboard should load even if profile creation is slow"
echo "   - Profile data should appear when ready (avatar, name, etc.)"
echo "   - No infinite loading states"
echo ""

echo "🐛 If you still see loading issues:"
echo "   1. Check browser console for error messages"
echo "   2. Look for 'Profile creation timeout' messages"
echo "   3. Verify that the Dashboard loads even without profile data"
echo "   4. Check the debug tools in the Dashboard sidebar"
echo ""

echo "📖 Debug tools available:"
echo "   - ProfileDebug: Test profile creation and retrieval"
echo "   - UserDataDebug: See raw user data structure"
echo "   - Browser console: Check for profile creation logs"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Loading fix status: READY FOR TESTING"
